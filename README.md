There are plenty of Uploaders for Linux and Commandline, most of them are for powerusers. For me as a user who wants to
upload something from time-to-time i wanted to create a GUI which takes some work for me (RAR/PAR/SFV and upload it).

This Software is still in development stage, so not working in any ways.
